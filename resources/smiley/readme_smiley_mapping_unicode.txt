The mapping has been done with the following resource :
http://apps.timwhitlock.info/emoji/tables/unicode

The file has to be opened in another editor to correctly display unicode symbols. I suggest SublimeText or gedit.
The encoding is utf-8.

The mapping emoji - description has been done following these rules :
- A line must be in the form "x \t description" where x is the symbol to replace
- The description should be simple and generalize the most.
    As an example, ":)", ";)" and "=D" should be tagged as "happy".
    However, when this generalization is not possible, the description should be as close as the description
    in the link above as possible, while staying simple : "FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SWEAT" could become "cold sweat".

This smiley list contains an exhaustive list of the Emoji Unicode block, while some other emojis can be added, one by one, as they are encountered in the corpus.

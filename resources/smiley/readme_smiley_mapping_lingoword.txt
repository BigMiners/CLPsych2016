Description : smiley mapping (from smiley to word / signification), in alphabetical order. 

Attemps to clean the smiley descriptions to reduce them to a smaller number :
- replaced happiness by happy, everything similar to ";)", ":)", "=D", etc...
- replaced "unhappy" by "sad"
- replaced "sad face" by "sad" since a smiley is already a face.
- removed adjectives and poncuation (i-e "Big wet kiss!" -> "kiss")
- replaced "male organ", "male sex organ" by "p*nis"
- replaced "surprised" by "surprise" to merge the two of them : 12+13 occurrences
- removed duplicates for 
	- ":-x" "can't talk"
	- ":-)))" "happy"

- replaced "very happy" by "happy", "very angry" by "angry", etc..

In the second version, every smiley with an occurence of 1 was removed, if it could not be associated with another description.
